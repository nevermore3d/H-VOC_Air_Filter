### WHY SHOULD I CARE?

3D printers emit fumes while printing. Some non-toxic, some really bad ones. While good ventilation helps, not all areas where 3d printers are placed are adequately ventilated. This allows for particle concentration buildup, and higher levels of dangerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 

Besides VOCs, micron-sized particles small enough not to be removed by airway ciliae are also released. Absorbed by the body, building up over the years, a more rapid lung function loss from aging from tissue deposition could possibly result with time, even if the particles themselves should prove non-toxic (which we do no know). The body simply can’t break down micro plastics. 
Additional dangers in your surroundings such as smoking, asbestos or city air pollution poses synergistic risks – arguing that you already are in danger since you smoke so you don’t have to care about lesser evils such as printer fumes is most likely wrong! For example, fact is it’s pretty hard to get cancer from asbestos alone if you don’t smoke – you usually need to be exposed to both as they aggravate the individual risks tenfold.

What’s worse, certain filament fumes contain known harmful substances, such as hormonally disruptive Bisphenols in polycarbonate (PC) or known cancerogenic or cardiovascular disease-promoting compounds such as butadiene and styrene in ABS. Kids stuff are labeled BPA free, as we don’t want them to be sterile or get prostate/breast cancer when they're older. Then we_ probably_ shouldn’t release is as a gas in their home either. Not without a Voron H-VOC installed, that is.
How many weeks, months or years do you want to keep inhaling your 3D printer fumes?

### I’VE WORKED WITH PLASTICS ALL MY LIFE, THE DANGERS ARE WAY OVERRATED!

If you live alone - not impacting other people – and feel that way, this filter is not for you! 
After all, you’re perfectly allowed to smoke two packs a day or become a opposition politician in Russia too, even though it’s probably not optimal for your health. And on an individual level one can never be sure what the health effects will be, if any - the oldest person ever used to smoke until she was 118 years or so…

##### But speaking of what we do know, we can say for sure that:
•	The WHO:s International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) classifies chemical compounds based on the known evidence of human carcinogenics, into four classes (carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, possibly carcinogenic or not classifiable as carcinogenic to humans). Most chemicals fall into the last category, but in the known carcinogenic groups we find several known 3d printer byproducts:
#### o	Benzene. 
One of the main fumes from ABS printing. 3ppm regarded as safe, whereas up to 280 ppm of VOCs are produced ABS printing every hour in a small space. Proven to cause different leukemias, and suspected of causing a multitude of other cancers. Female workers in a shoe factory exposed to 40ppm for a long time had a hundredfold higher risk of dying from breast cancer, for instance. Class 1 carcinogenic.
#### o	Styrene 
Main pollutant in ABS fumes, recently upgraded from possible to probable carcinogenic based on mounting evidence of connection with a close to tripled risk of different leukemias.
#### o	Butadiene – 
Another component of ABS printing, and the reason why styrene didn’t get the carcinogenic label for so long (as both are ABS byproducts it was long impossible to know if a cancer type was due to butadiene or styrene. Butadiene is also a known cause and/or cofactor in cardiovascular disease, so you might get your heart attack or stroke a few years earlier by breathing it in for a long time.
### Other knowns:
•	What creates the most particles/VOCs from plastics handling is heated extrusion. 

•	Injection molding, vacuum forming and other common industrial methods creates less air pollutants due to less melted plastic surface per kg with direct air/oxygen access/airflow. 

•	3D printing extrusion takes this to another VOC creation level, as you’re extruding thin layer by thin layer, not trapping any of the extruded melted material from access to oxygen or airflow. Thus, per kilogram of product, it’s the most particle and VOC generating plastic process there is. 

•	Home 3d printers are often used in places without industrial ventilation or industrial wet scrubbing. Indeed, a recent study showed that levels of VOC carcinogenics in plastics recycling plants using heated extrusion processes were mostly within safe limits. However, in surrounding residential homes of those safe-to-work plants, VOC levels were up to 42 times the safe limits and consisted of the ventilated byproducts from the plastic plants, due to lower ventilation requirements in homes. The study showed a clear increased lifetime cancer risk, even for the workers of the plants.

This is a short list of some key knowns, and only address the most common ABS fumes. Other materials have different VOCs. PETG for instance, releases Toluene, Acetaldehyde, Formaldehyde – all of which are known health hazards. Regular PLA and Nylons without additives are usually pretty safe though, with release of lower levels of acetone, methyl-methacrylate, and iso-butanol (PLA) and Propylene Glycol and Cyclopentanone (Nylon). Not all fumes are created equal!

### BUT I HAVE THE EXHAUST FILTER ALREADY INSTALLED!
Good start! Do you change the filters regularly? A fresh active carbon filter pack can absorb up to 70% of the gaseous particles (the VOCs) from the fumes. However, it won’t filter micron sized plastic particles, and what’s worse – the VOC filtering capacity drops quickly as the active carbon of the mesh gets saturated. If you occasionally use such filters, like while doing soldering work, it’d last longer. Likewise, larger carbon filters used in areas without a source of VOC generation – such as regular household air purifiers – can keep carbon capacity for at least a few months. 
But - actively filtering the air from a VOC generating printer you regularly use for hours? Not so much.
Weighing the exhaust filter carbon mesh, we can quickly conclude the amount of actual active carbon could amount to at-most tens of grams. This means the VOC-filtering capacity will be depleted in weeks, not months, if used regularly for printing. And those 70% with fresh filters quickly drops for each and every print, perhaps still taking out about half of the VOCs after a single week (if you’re using quality meshes). And you’re still breathing in all accumulating particles.

### FORTUNATELY, I GOT AN AIR PURIFIER IN MY HOME ALSO. THEN I’M GOOD?
Most air purifiers have a HEPA filter, meaning they filter out nano plastic particles. In combination with fresh exhaust filters on your Voron, it’s probably adequate! Problem is, as stated above, few people will remember or even afford to swap filters as often as the low active carbon content of the exhaust would require. And when your room purifier has to combat the VOCs, things get ugly.
Most household purifiers also use carbon filtering for VOCs. If in a room where no VOCs are generated, the larger carbon capacity of most air purifiers lasts for 3-6 months. However, if you are actively melting plastics in the area, it will deplete much quicker. Also, household purifiers filter replacements cost a lot to buy – and mostly only come in triple filter formulations you don’t actually need (no need to change a fresh HEPA that would last another 8 months to a year just because you depleted the carbon in three weeks.

Other purifier filtering measures found in home purifiers are negative ion generation - which doesn’t affect most 3d printer VOCs, and disinfecting UV light (does nothing for VOCs). 
When UV is combined with titanium dioxide (TiO2) meshes, Photochemical Oxidation (PCO) filtering occurs, which DOES break down VOCs. Though not instantly, and can actually first create more dangerous chemicals on the first reaction such as benzene. You will find PCO filters in a select few home air purifiers, which is great. However, the main drawbacks are two: 1) VOC inactivation takes a lot of time with PCO (half-life of several hours while continuously adding more VOCs with a running printer) and 2) TiO2 particles get saturated/inactivated by silica. So, any household wall dust in the air – gypsum residues for example - permanently inactivates the filtering capacity until the Ti02 mesh is washed. Which it usually isn’t designed to be… Thus, if exposed to silica containing compounds, a PCO filter is effectively not working anymore. And you have no way of knowing when and if that happens.
What about ozone? Yeah, removes VOCs. But also harmful/toxic to you.

### SO – WHATEVER I DO, I’M SCREWED? GIVE ME A SOLUTION DAMNIT!
Duct the fumes outside! The micro plastic particles probably lodge in your ghastly neighbor instead, or fish! The sun destroys the VOCs. All good!
For anyone not being able to duct your printer fumes, worry not – The Voron H-VOC got you covered.

### WHAT THE RAVEN IS THE VORON H-VOC?
The Voron H-VOC is the air filter most other hobby 3d printer owners only can wish for. Some even say it’s the final solution to printer pollution! With ‘some’, I mean me.
The H-VOC addresses all key issues with other filter shortcomings:
1.	It uses an **insane amount of active carbon**, lasting multitudes longer than other filters.
2.	Its **triple cartridge** based, meaning you can rotate fresh and older carbon cartridges, maintaining an even filtering capacity _all the time_.
3.	Its **super cheap to maintain**, using active carbon pellets that can be purchased for virtually nothing (10kgs/20 pounds for like a 100 bucks, lasting a lifetime, or 2 pounds for 50 bucks lasting two years for ultra-high VOC removal capacity.
4.	For particles, the H-VOC carbon combines with carbon dust prefilter and dual nano-particle absorbing **HEPA**. Just the two filter types the 3d printer user needs, but in a capacity ratio that isn’t available elsewhere!
5.	It **re-circulates the air into the printer enclosure**, keeping your chamber temps up while continuously cleaning the air. Thus, where a regular exhaust at peak efficiency removes 70% of VOCs and perhaps 10% of particles while spewing 30/90% into the air around you, the Voron H-VOC at lowest efficiency removes >90% if the enclosed printer air passes the filter only three times before escaping, and every filter operates at just 20% removal. And that’s if you forget to replace your filters. Which you shouldn’t! 
a.	At 50% per cartridge efficiency, removal is **99.998% on three passes**. The Voron H-VOC will thus allow for doing nasty stuff inside the confines of your enclosure, like laser cutting acrylics without the fumes making your head and eyes hurt.
6.	Fear not, the filter has an **adjustable air escape**, keeping the pressure inside the enclosure negative to avoid leakage of contaminated air, or for the times where you print more non-toxic materials like PLA (where you’d also want a cooler chamber).
7.	To keep you from forgetting when to change cartridges, the integrated month markings keeps you from forgetting when you swapped your last cartridge.
8.	Finally, the H-VOC is made to **not increase the footprint** of the printer. At about two inches deep, it doesn’t protrude more than the regular exhaust, though it uses most of the backplate on a 250mm model to accomplish this.

### THIS SOUNDS TOO FRIGGING AWESOME!? WHATS THE DOWNSIDE?
Noise? Does it even create air flow? To have enough pressure for three carbon filters plus the pressure drop of the HEPA, radial fans are required. Driving the unit is a 97x33mm Sunon, drawing up to 42 Watts and 62 dB at full speed… Combined with smaller exhaust fans to create hot air circulation and mixing inside the enclosure, as well as allow the Sunon to run slower and quieter. 
Hopefully, the unit at sufficient power will not raise noise levels much above ambient printing noise while still circulating enough air to maintain multiple filtration of the enclosure.

But hey – it worth it.
